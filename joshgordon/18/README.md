I was having debugging issues with this one. All of the sample inputs worked fine, but my answer was still
wrong, so I stole (erm, borrowed) someone else's part2 solution from reddit and modified it to print out the
same format as mine (in stolen_2.py). I then diffed it, and found an example of one that was broken, which I
proceeded to use as a test case to get mine working right.

It works right now, and I'm happy, but I never want to debug this again.
